### WORKFLOW


## Text Classifier

● Programmatically generated synthetics dataset of investor input
● Labelled the dataset as different constraints such as “Has Tobacco”,”Has
military” etc.
● Used nltk library to generate different word synonyms
● Created a corpus of ~ 30,000 investor inputs
● Used a pre-trained spaCy text-classification model to predict different
constraints
● Text classifier predicts the final constraints to be applied to the investor’s
tradable portfolio


## Portfolio Optimization using time series data

```
● Extracted time series data of the given stocks from Yahoo Finance
● Extracted exponentially weighted mean returns of the stocks from the time
series data of stock prices
● Covariance matrix of the stocks constructed using time series analysis
● Generated Markowitz Portfolio maximising Sharpe Ratio
```

## Different portfolio optimization models

● Efficient frontier optimisation via quadratic programming
● Hierarchical Risk Parity, using clustering algorithms to choose uncorrelated
assets
○ From a universe of assets, form a distance matrix based on the correlation of the assets.
○ Using this distance matrix, cluster the assets into a tree via hierarchical clustering
○ Within each branch of the tree, form the minimum variance portfolio (normally between just
two assets.
○ Iterates over each level, optimally combining the mini-portfolios at each node.
● Markowitz Critical Line Algorithm
○ Robust alternative to the quadratic solver used to find mean-variance optimal portfolios
○ Unlike generic quadratic optimisers, the CLA is specially designed for portfolio optimisation
○ Guaranteed to converge after a certain number of iterations, and can efficiently derive the
entire efficient frontier


● Black-Litterman Allocation
○ Takes a Bayesian approach to asset allocation
○ It combines a prior estimate of returns (canonically, the market-implied returns) with views on
certain assets, to produce a posterior estimate of expected returns.
○ Can provide views on only a subset of assets and BL will meaningfully propagate it, taking into
account the covariance with other assets.
○ Using Black-Litterman posterior returns results in much more stable portfolios than using
mean-historical return
